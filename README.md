Breast-cancer-prediction
This project aims to predict whether breast cancer is benign or malignant using Logistic Regression. The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset, which consists of numerical features like radius, texture, perimeter, and area of cell nuclei from biopsy samples. The objective is to classify tumors based on these features to assist in early detection and diagnosis.

The project covers data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Logistic Regression was chosen for its effectiveness in binary classification tasks. The performance of the model is assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable predictions.
